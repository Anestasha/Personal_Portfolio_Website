                  I graduated in spring 2020 and attended the ceremony the following year due to COVID-19 restrictions.

                My love of learning has been apparent to myself and my family since I was young. As far back as I can remember, I have been curious about the world and how it works.

                In middle school, I helped test a pilot program my school considered offering. Through this program, I had the opportunity to begin high school classes; I started with history and finished my high school history requirements before arriving.

                Once in high school, my appetite for learning intensified, surpassing what my local high school could offer. I decided to continue my high school education online through a local public district, which allowed me to expand my areas of study. By the time I was a junior in high school, I was a full-time college student.

                While starting my general education requirements, I fell in love with mathematics and science, which led me to pursue an associate’s degree in Engineering.
                In May 2020, I graduated from Lewis-Clark State College (LCSC) with an Associate of Science in Engineering; 13 days later, I graduated high school. After graduation, I returned to LCSC to pursue two bachelor’s degrees: Computer Science and Mathematics. I will graduate this spring, 2024.

# Personal Portfolio
## Overview
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built using the Foundation framework. This personal portfolio website aims to inform visitors about my background and a comprehensive list of my academic history, projects, and special interests.

## Development
- The 'Featured Projects' and 'Special Interest' pages are in active development; several pre-existing projects need to be added to each page.
- Currently researching Meta and YouTube APIs for embedded content.

**_Accessibility is a priority._** I frequently utilize the [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) to check the site's accessibility and stay informed of any necessary improvements. I aim to keep the site compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/).Â 

**Needed Accessibility Improvements:**
- **Video Alternate Content:** Provide text alternatives or transcripts for the videos on the site ([standard 1.2.3: Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?showtechniques=123#audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded)).
- **Link Contrast:** Update styling to improve the color contrast of links ([standard 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?showtechniques=123#contrast-minimum))

Any feedback and suggestions to further the accessibility of this project are welcome.

## Pages
### 1. Personal Overview
This page introduces who I am and my love for learning. It details my educational journey, starting from middle school and progressing through high school and college.

### 2. Featured Projects
This page showcases my most notable projects, including school assignments, personal undertakings, and significant achievements. Each project includes a description, some kind of media (images, embedded content, screenshots/recordings, etc.), and links or repositories where applicable.

### 3. Class History
This page provides a comprehensive list of the classes I've taken. The first section is organized by semester - users can navigate through semesters using a dropdown menu to display the classes taken that semester. The second section is organized by topic. 

In each section, specific computer science classes are underlined. Hovering over these class names (or clicking on mobile) will display a list of the main languages and technologies used during that class.

### 4. Special Interests
This page focuses on personal interests outside of academics, including hobbies, volunteer projects, and personal creations. This page highlights these special interests, including reptile care, fiber arts, projects made for at-home use, and various other creative endeavors.

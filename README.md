# Personal Portfolio
## Overview
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built using the Foundation framework. This personal portfolio website aims to provide visitors with information about my background and a comprehensive list of my academic history, projects, and special interests.

## Development
The 'Featured Projects' and 'Special Interest' pages are in active development; several pre-existing projects need to be added to each page.

## Pages
### 1. Personal Overview
This page introduces who I am and my love for learning. It details my educational journey, starting from middle school and progressing through high school and college.

### 2. Featured Projects
This page showcases my most notable projects, including school assignments, personal undertakings, and significant achievements. Each project includes a description, some kind of media (images, embedded content, screenshots/recordings, etc.), and links or repositories where applicable.

### 3. Class History
This page provides a comprehensive list of the classes I've taken. The first section is organized by semester - users can navigate through semesters using a dropdown menu to display the classes taken that semester. The second section is organized by topic. 

In each section, specific computer science classes are underlined. Hovering over these class names (or clicking on mobile) will display a list of the main languages and technologies used during that class.

### 4. Special Interests
This page focuses on personal interests outside of academics, including hobbies, volunteer projects, and personal creations. This page highlights these special interests, including reptile care, fiber arts, projects made for at-home use, and various other creative endeavors.

## Technologies

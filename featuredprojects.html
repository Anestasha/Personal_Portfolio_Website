                  This pumpkin was designed and carved for a campus-wide pumpkin carving contest at Lewis-Clark State College in 2021. I created it for the Math and Science Tutoring Center (MSTC) while working there as a tutor.

                <p>
                  After a semester-long study on the captivity of orcas, students began creating original pieces of art that reflected the semester’s themes. This two-and-a-half-minute video was my final project. Finally, a local art gallery hosted an event where each student’s art was displayed. <br>
                  One of the attendees that night was author <a href="https://www.rachelclarkauthor.com/">Rachel Clark</a>, who had been in contact with the trainers interviewed for the film Blackfish. After watching my video, she requested a shareable link to forward to those trainers. I was lucky (and a trainer was kind enough) to reach out to me with an email, thanking me for the art I created.
